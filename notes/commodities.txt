gold, oil, natural gas, and etc. are commodities (complicated to invest in commodities)
WHY? -> how are you gonna store a barrel of oil by yourself
     -> so instead of buying commodity futures, you can instead buy stock of a company which are related, i.e. gold and gold mining companies.
        May not be directly correlated but will show a positive correlation.

Commodities are extremely volatile => so we use FUTURES!!!

Futures are made in an attempt by producers and suppliers of commodities to AVOID MARKET VOLATILITY
- Essentially they negotiate the price of a given commodity in the future (you decide to sell something at a certain price at a certain date. Basically a promise)

i.e. airlines are strongly effected by oil price, so they use oil futures to protect them from rising oil prices.

Future market => i.e. New York Mercantile Exchange

Commodity prices typically rise when inflation is accelerating (this is why commodities such as oil or gold usually offer protection from the effects of inflation)
- i guess it is because a tangible object such as commodity has a fixed "value" regardless of the currency power unlike stocks which are shares of futures earnings which
is susceptible to inflation.
- as it is less susceptible to rising inflation, we can include it in our portfolio with stocks
