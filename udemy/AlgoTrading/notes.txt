starting anaconda virtual environment:
- Why? : To reduce version conflicts caused due to dependencies of some libraries.
- How? : Create a new environment by "conda create --name `name of environment` python=`version of python`"; i.e. "conda create --name quant python=3.11"
Then to activate the environment we can just use "conda activate `name of environment`"; so "conda activate quant" in this case.

To start anaconda navigator: "anaconda-navigator";

To see the existing conda virtual environments: "conda info --envs"

little tip -> in Ubuntu we need to run "active `name of environment`" to start the environment.
Also using python 3.8 to avoid dependencies

Using yfinance API instead of panda_datareader(deprecated). (installed)
